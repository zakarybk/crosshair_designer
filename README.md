# Garry's Mod Crosshair Designer (Remastered)

**I recommend using the workshop version listed below. Sometimes I may push unfinished edits to master! But the workshop will always contain a checked version.**

The addon now supports
* TTT
* FA:S
* CW 2.0
* M9k
* TFA
* ArcCW

It has been re-written from the ground up (although the saving has been mostly untouched for the moment). It may or may not have better performance now, but it should work a lot better with weapon packs since the crosshair will now be hidden when aiming down sights for the weapon packs listed above. There have also been a few other improvements like cleaner code (for the most part) and now the menu updates properly when you load a new crosshair. Crosshair sharing has also been implemented, so now you can copy the settings to your clipboard and load them in the menu!
